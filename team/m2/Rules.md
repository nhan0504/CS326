# Coding Practice (Subject to change)

## Commits

Every member should push their codes/ progress every Friday.
This is to make sure that everyone can keep track of what everyone is doing, and resolve any potential problems

## Review

After committing their files, each member need to ask another member to review their codes to ensure everything functions normally.
If a person needs a reviewer, we can use the slack channel (reviewer-request) and tag any other member in the group to be the designated reviewer.

## Progress tracking

To track what the members are doing, each member will need to update their tasks on Jira/Trello.
