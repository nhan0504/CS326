- Cost-per-wear for each item (calculated by dividing the price by the number of times it has been worn)
- Wear frequency by category (e.g., tops, bottoms, shoes)

Users can also set personal goals, such as reducing the cost-per-wear of certain items or redistributing the use of their wardrobe more evenly. The dashboard can suggest decluttering or donating rarely worn items to encourage more mindful consumption.
