# Feature description
The Statistics on Clothing Worn feature provides users with a visual dashboard to gain insights into their wardrobe usage patterns. This feature displays various metrics and charts based on clothing usage data stored in the app. Key functionalities include:
- Most-Worn Items: Shows the top 5 items in the wardrobe that are worn most frequently.
- Least-Worn or Never-Worn Items: Highlights items that have been rarely or never used.
- Cost-Per-Wear: Calculates the cost effectiveness of each item by dividing the itemâ€™s purchase cost by the number of times it has been worn.
- Wear Frequency by Category: Summarizes usage frequency across categories (e.g., tops, bottoms, shoes).
- Download Option: Allows users to download an image of their wardrobe statistics so they can share with others
